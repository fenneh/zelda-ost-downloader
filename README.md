# üéµ Zelda Universe Music Downloader

*"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this music downloader."*

A script to download The Legend of Zelda music from Zelda Universe's music archive. Available in both Python and PowerShell versions (like parallel worlds in A Link to the Past!).

## ‚ú® Features

- Downloads all albums from Zelda Universe's music archive (faster than a Hookshot!)
- Organizes music into album folders (more organized than Link's item inventory)
- Skips existing files for resumable downloads (like Save Points)
- Shows download progress (no need for Navi to tell you what's happening)
- Handles connection errors with retries (more persistent than a Stalchild)
- URL-decodes filenames properly (decodes better than the Song of Time)

## üêç Python Version

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (as essential as the Master Sword)
- `requests` (like bottles, but for HTTP)
- `beautifulsoup4` (parses HTML better than the Great Deku Tree parses riddles)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository (like pulling the Master Sword):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zelda-music-downloader
   cd zelda-music-downloader
   ```

2. Install required packages (collecting items for your adventure):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

```bash
python zelda_music_downloader.py
```

## ü™ü PowerShell Version

### Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 6.0+ (like having an upgraded sword)
- Internet connection (your link to the Sacred Realm)

### Usage

Run in PowerShell (play the Song of Downloads):
```powershell
.\zelda_music_downloader.ps1
```

Note: You might need to allow script execution first (like opening a dungeon):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üìÇ Output

Both scripts will (like the three golden goddesses):
1. Create a `zelda_music` directory (Din's directory of power)
2. Create subdirectories for each album (Nayru's organization of wisdom)
3. Download all MP3 files into their respective album folders (Farore's gift of life... er, music)
